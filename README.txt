The double spike toolbox
Copyright (c) John F. Rudge 2009

Requirements: MATLAB 7.1 (R14SP3) or higher with the Statistics and Optimization Toolboxes. It may work with older versions too, but has not been tested.

Quick start instructions:

1, Extract the contents of the zip file to a folder on the hard drive.
2, Add the doublespike folder to your MATLAB path. (From MATLAB's menu: File-> Set Path->Add Folder)
3, Type 'doc doublespike' for a brief guide to the toolbox or 'help doublespike' to get a list of commands.

"maininput.csv" contains the isotope numbers, atomic weights, standard compositions, and ORNL spike compositions for all the elements. These can be modified as desired (e.g. with more precise standard compositions or different commercial spike compositions).
